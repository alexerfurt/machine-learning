    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like.

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.Model: Gaussian Naive Bayes** (1,2,5)\n",
    " - **Real-world application:** To classify emails as spam or not spam or text classification in general\n",
    " - **Strengths:** rather easy to build, computational efficiency (esp. helpful when resources are limited), fast, many features/ large datasets, not sensitive to irrelevant features, able to do multiclass classification\n",
    " - **Weaknesses:** Underlying assumption that features are independent (\"naive\" assumption), i.e. it cannot learn interactions between features.\n",
    " - **Justification:** suitable for binary classification, simple and fast (resource efficient) so worth a try, will converge very quick if the naive (independent features) assumption holds true, can train on rather small data sets\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.Model: Random Forest (Ensemble of Decision Trees)** (2,5)\n",
    " - **Real-world application:** Predict loan approvals/ eligibility or predict whether a loan will default or be paid off\n",
    " - **Strengths:** simplicity, easily handles heterogeneous data (even with small datasets), reduced chance for overfitting compared to simple Decision Trees, good when features have interactions (i.e. are not completely independent), able to do multiclass classification, includes almost all hyperparameters of Decision Trees plus the ones of a bagging classifier to control the ensemble itself, wisdom of the crowd\n",
    " - **Weaknesses:** Overfitting can still easily happen especially with growing amount of data and/or noice in it\n",
    " - **Justification:** Suitable for binary classification, simple but yet powerful algorithm, features in dataset might not be completely independent and RF can deal with it, moreover it even allows for easy measuring of relative importance of features (which ones do really matter?). 'Wisdom of the crowd'-feature: aggregating many different decision trees trained on random subsets of data and features is promising, might yield in a super predictor!\n",
    " \n",
    "**3.Model: Support Vector Machines (2,3,4,5)**\n",
    " - **Real-world application:** Pattern recognition and classification, e.g. predicting whether a patient has a certain disease (sick vs. healthy)\n",
    " - **Strengths:** Highly accurate, works very well in high-dimensional space, has regularization parameter and kernel trick (i.e. less risk of overfitting, suitable for complex problems)\n",
    " - **Weaknesses:** Can be memory-intensive, hard to interpret and not easy to tune, sensitive to feature scale, scales poorly with the size of training set, strictly binary classifier (unless multiple binary classifier are used), long training times\n",
    " - **Justification:** Powerful algorithm suitable for binary classification, particular suited for small to mid-sized datasets, can handle more complex/ heterogeneous datasets like in this example, LinearSVC is suitable for problem and can be fast as well as accurate\n",

    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).\n",
    " - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.\n",
    " - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.\n",
    "   - Record the total prediction time.\n",
    " - Calculate the accuracy score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",
    " - Calculate the F-score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",

    "\n",
    "According to the F-Score when 100% of training data was used, the Random Forest as well as the linear Support Vector classifier are in a neck-and-neck race, with the former being marginally better. However, taking into consideration the training and prediction time, the overall picture is in favour of the linear SVM classification. There, our LinearSVC algorithm trains in half the time (~0.22 vs. ~0.45 sec) and is able to predict in just a 10th of the time compared to the RandomForest algorithm (~0.003 vs. ~0.033 sec).\n",
    "One can argue that CharityML might not be particularly keen in having an extremely fast and resource-efficient algorithm (esp. in the seconds) but rather be interested in overall model performance. However, there is another thing to consider. Looking also into accuracy and F-score on the training set (upper row of graphs), it suggests that there might be some overfitting going on with the RandomForest classifier, as the values are significantly higher compared to the testing set while for the SVM classifier its more or less about the same.\n",
    "Conclusively, the SVM classifier is the chosen model as it not only is faster, more resource efficient, but also highly likely to generalize better while keeping an F-score (100%) that is among the highest. It's great performance on all of this lies in the suitability of this algorithm for the dataset. Which is not too big with moderate size in features (creating sparsity as many were categorical before one-hot-encoding) and pre-processed in the right way (normalized and scaled 0-1) as SVM e.g. is sensitive to features scale.\n"

    "Imagine that there are many examples of people with their different backgrounds & characteristics, and we are separating them into two classes. One earns less than 50K/y, while the other class earns more than 50K/y. What the SVM model does is to find the line that separates those two classes given all the data we know from them. Moreover, it's not only trying to find a fine line but the widest possible \"street\" between them. During training, the goal of this algorithm is to find the largest possible margin (\"street\") between the decision boundary that separates those two classes. Any example - meaning in your case any person with all its data - that is on the border of this decision boundery, will be a Support Vector after training. All others \"off the street\" - so not Support Vectors, have no influence nor relevance going forward. For prediction, the new example will be compared to those support vectors in order to classify them as one of the two classes (i.e. behind which side of the \"street\" they will stand). And so, the wider the \"street\" the better and more accurate the model will be able to predict a new candidates class (i.e. more or less than $50K/y).\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most relevant features for prediction identified by the RandomForest classifier are in some way close to what I discussed in Q6, but also surprising in another. Let's get into the details:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Age**: This was my 4/5 most important features, so I correctly identified it as being important and I think I also found a good explaination for it, however, I clearly underestimated its overall importance. The graph suggests that the sole age has a weight of almost a fourth (~25%) in a prediction and double the amount of features number two.\n",
    "* **Education-num**: Here, I overestimated the education level as it was No.3 for me compared to No.5 for this model. Also, I decided to take the more qualitative record of highest education degree instead of the numbers of years. My assumption was that years might be as distinctive as a degree, e.g. one can spend many extra years to get a HS diploma or a Bachelor if he or she struggles with it.\n",
    "* **Marital-Status**: Specifically the status \"Married-civ-spouse\", the model identified as No.4 of most important feautres. I would argue that I was close here as I mentioned \"Relationship\" status as important, i.e. having a solid & stable relationship in one's life. The model suggests that its particularly being married, which I think could be influenced by things like tax benefits or indeed that a marriage is helpful in climbing up the career ledder and/or handle high-skill/high-paid jobs better.\n",
    "* **Hours-per-week & Capital Gain**: I completely missed both of these. I was considering the amount of work in hs/week at first, however, decided to not include it in my Top5 as I didn't necessarily see correlation or even causation. For instance, people in low-paid jobs or maybe with two of them, can accumulate a lot of hours per week but not necessarily earn much while doing so. However, I might have overthought that one and there is a correlation after all. On the Capital Gain part, I was completely missing this one. For me, occupation and workclass seem to be more important, than capital gains that probably only few people might have. Clearly, I underestimated this one and it seems that having capital invested is a strong indicator for whether you achieve more than 50K/y or not."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
